    * @note
    *   - An exception is considered to have escaped (or left) the scope of a
    *     span, if that span is ended while the exception is still logically
    *     &quot;in flight&quot;. This may be actually &quot;in flight&quot; in
    *     some languages (e.g. if the exception is passed to a Context manager's
    *     `__exit__` method in Python) but will usually be caught at the point
    *     of recording the exception in most languages.
    *   - It is usually not possible to determine at the point where an
    *     exception is thrown whether it will escape the scope of a span.
    *     However, it is trivial to know that an exception will escape, if one
    *     checks for an active exception just before ending the span, as done in
    *     the <a href="#recording-an-exception">example for recording span
    *     exceptions</a>.
    *   - It follows that an exception may still escape the scope of the span
    *     even if the `exception.escaped` attribute was not set or set to false,
    *     since the event might have been recorded at a time where it was not
    *     clear whether the exception will escape.
