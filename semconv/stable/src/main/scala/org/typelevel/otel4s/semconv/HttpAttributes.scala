    *   - HTTP request method value SHOULD be &quot;known&quot; to the
    *     instrumentation. By default, this convention defines &quot;known&quot;
    *     methods as the ones listed in <a
    *     href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc9110.html#name-methods">RFC9110</a>
    *     and the PATCH method defined in <a
    *     href="https://www.rfc-editor.org/rfc/rfc5789.html">RFC5789</a>.
    *   - If the HTTP request method is not known to instrumentation, it MUST
    *     set the `http.request.method` attribute to `_OTHER`.
    *   - If the HTTP instrumentation could end up converting valid HTTP request
    *     methods to `_OTHER`, then it MUST provide a way to override the list
    *     of known HTTP methods. If this override is done via environment
    *     variable, then the environment variable MUST be named
    *     OTEL_INSTRUMENTATION_HTTP_KNOWN_METHODS and support a comma-separated
    *     list of case-sensitive known HTTP methods (this list MUST be a full
    *     override of the default known method, it is not a list of known
    *     methods in addition to the defaults).
    *   - HTTP method names are case-sensitive and `http.request.method`
    *     attribute value MUST match a known HTTP method name exactly.
    *     Instrumentations for specific web frameworks that consider HTTP
    *     methods to be case insensitive, SHOULD populate a canonical
    *     equivalent. Tracing instrumentations that do so, MUST also set
    *     `http.request.method_original` to the original value.
